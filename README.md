My project is the Third Eye for the Blind. Its main objective is to help visually impaired people help have an idea of their surroundings, acting as a working eye for them. It works through an ultrasonic sensor that senses the distance of objects, then through code, will let the person know how close they're getting to an object by either a noise or vibration. This device would not only improve the quality of life for visually impaired individuals but also open up new opportunities for them to explore the world around them.
